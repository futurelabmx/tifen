<p>I'm Jared Sellers. I'm an illustrator-in-training, currently a senior at BYU Idaho. I realized pretty early on in my education that I loved problem solving, and I also loved art. Meshing those two together has lead to an extremely rewarding career solving creative problems for interesting people all over the world.   
    <span class="rightsmall">In the past I have done book covers, animated shorts, murals, marketing campaigns, websites, branding packages, among many others. I'll never turn down the chance to do something new that can push the boundaries of your field, your company, or your living room.</span>
    <span class="leftsmall"> I've grown to love Idaho, where I live with my wife Samantha, and our child, affectionately named "Our Nintendo Switch".</span>
    <span class="rightbig">To put it to rest, I am a PC guy, but can respect Macs all the same.</span>
