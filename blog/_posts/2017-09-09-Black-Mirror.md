Black Mirror is a return to form for dramatic anthology tv. Following in the footsteps of shows like The Twilight Zone, it wraps a full, unique story into each episode. It is a dark, bleak take on the world we live in, pushing the boundaries of what is possible to return the worst possible consequences. There is a common theme of technology, the role it plays in our lives, and all the ways that it may not be making our lives better. 

At 13 episodes long, spread across 3 short seasons, it is easily accessible without dominating your tv habits for the next year. It's quickly become one of my absolute favorite shows, although it won't be for you if you want happy endings and stable characters. Black Mirror is all about psychological twists, grim prospects and societal issues. Have fun with it.

Since every episode is unique, it leads to a lot of discussion over which episodes are better than others. Black Mirror runs a wide gamut, with some episodes being drastically different than others. Part of the appeal of the show in general, is that different episodes will "speak" to different people. Nobody has the same favorite episode, and there are very few duds. I wanted to put my two cents into the discussion, with my thoughts on all thirteen episodes. I will keep it as spoiler free as possible, so don't worry if you haven't seen the show yet.

### 13. The National Anthem
The first episode of Black Mirror is also by far the darkest. Really, really messed up. At the same time, it's a spectacular episode, and really should be ranked a lot higher on my list. The reason it is in last place is more out of principle. It's seriously disturbing. Black Mirror pushes boundaries in every episode, but The National Anthem wins a special award for being the *worst*. It is the only episode that I would even consider skipping entirely. 

### 12. The Waldo Moment
The Waldo Moment is really the only episode that I disliked. There are a lot of redeeming qualities, I just can't get past how annoying the titular "Waldo" is. It was overall just a lukewarm episode, even if it wasn't inherently bad. It came into the spotlight within the past year, however, as a lot of people drew parallels to the rise of Donald Trump. 

### 11. Playtest
I'm on the fence on this episode. It is the only episode to deal with video games, albiet in a futuristic, immersive VR format. It strays into horror territory, which isn't where Black Mirror works best, but it still retains a sense of purpose that makes it worth watching. There are a lot of great things going on in the episode, but somehow it still feels a little muddied.   

### 10. Be Right Back
Be Right Back is a heck of a love story, approached from a very unconventional angle. It's an unnerving look at loss, grief, and moving on. It's a brilliant episode, and considering it is still only ranked as my number 10, speaks volumes about how I regard the show as a whole.
	
### 9. Nosedive
The first episode of the Netflix produced season 3 lives up to the Black Mirror legacy. Nosedive takes a sharp knife to our attachment to likes, follows, and views, to great effect. This episode hits really close to home for me, as someone disenchanted with the addictive culture of social media. It touched on a lot of sentiments that I have held for a while, and even called me out on some of my own bad habits.

### 8. Men Against Fire
The military episode. Men Against Fire embraces all the tropes of horror sci-fi, taking cues from Alien, District 9 and others. It showcases the emotional struggles of our men in arms, and everything that we do to cope with trauma. But in true Black Mirror fashion, the stakes are amped up to eleven, and the tension doesn't let up. As an aside, it is the only episode with full frontal nudity, for those who are sensitive in their tastes.

### 7. San Junipero
This episode tops out as a fan favorite, and is considered to be the "happy episode". I think to sum it up as a happy ending is to give it a disservice as a Black Mirror episode. There is so much more complexity to the episode than just happy or sad ending. Overall, it is a really compelling love story, with an ending that is simultaneous satisfying, and leaves you wanting more.

### 6. Shut Up and Dance

Shut up and Dance will leave you with your jaw on the floor. The less I can say about it, the better. It's dark, relentless, and worst of all, completely possible. Blackmail has never been so intense.

### 5. White Bear
Another fan favorite, it sets up a premise that keeps you glued to the screen until literally the last moment. You realize quickly how little you understand about the world our character finds herself in, and unravelling the mysteries is just as exciting as the explosive finale.

### 4. Hated in the Nation
The final episode of season 3, and the longest episode to date at an hour and a half. I was worried that the length would detract from the story, with most episodes running at the forty minute mark. But it was absolutely worth it. The show plays out like a police procedural, but with an absurd science fiction spin. You can't read too far into it, but it was such a wild and enjoyable ride that it earned the number four spot for it's sheer audacity to exist.

### 3. White Christmas
An anthology within an anthology. The christmas special of Black Mirror weaves three seperate stories together within the same universe, and does so magnificently. It is the perfect blend of everything that I want out of a movie or tv show. The technology is intriguing, the story is captivating, and the ending is mind blowing.

### 2. Fifteen Million Merits
I grew up begrudgingly watching American Idol and America's got Talent, and it is still somewhat of a family tradition that I really don't care much for. Those sorts of shows never really appealed to me, hanging so much effort on such a small chance of success. Fifteen Million Merits capitalizes on that train of thought, and runs with the idea until it reaches it's bleak conclusion. This episode takes the most liberties with science fiction, taking us well into the future where the world is a dystopian mess, then focuses in on the lives of a few small cogs in the machine. It's futile, beautiful and I loved it. 

### 1. Entire History of You
My absolute favorite episode is also one of the least exciting. The technology in the episode exists only enough to magnify problems that already exist in our lives. Our lives are constantly connected and documented through social media, that Entire History of You seems more like a cautionary tale than a spooky bed time story. The episode hits on trust and accountability in ways that are already applicable today, and I think it's that relatable quality that makes it so frightening. This is the episode that showcases Black Mirror at it's finest, and that is why it is my number one pick for best Black Mirror episode.
